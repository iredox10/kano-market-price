# Project Enhancement Ideas

Here are some ideas to make the Kano Price Checker application even better.

### 1. Enhance the User Experience
- [ ] **Interactive Map View:** Integrate a map (like OpenStreetMap or Google Maps) to visually show market and shop locations. Users could find the best prices geographically and get directions.
- [ ] **Real-time Price Notifications:** Implement push notifications or email alerts to inform users when a product on their watchlist drops to a certain price or becomes available in a nearby shop.
- [ ] **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Go beyond basic search. Allow users to filter products by location, shop ratings, product availability, or even specific neighborhoods in Kano.
- [ ] **User Reviews & Ratings:** Let users rate and review shops and products. This builds trust and community, helping others make informed decisions.

### 2. Add Powerful Features for Shop Owners
- [ ] **Sales & Analytics Dashboard:** Provide shop owners with a dashboard showing product views, how many users have their items on a watchlist, and maybe even anonymized competitor price comparisons.
- [ ] **Inventory Management:** A simple tool for shop owners to manage their stock levels directly on your platform, which would improve the accuracy of product availability for users.
- [ ] **Promotions and Deals:** Allow shop owners to create and feature special promotions or daily deals that would be highlighted on the platform.

### 3. Leverage AI and Modern Tech
- [ ] **Price Trend Prediction:** Analyze historical price data to forecast future price trends for popular items, helping users decide when to buy.
- [ ] **Personalized Recommendations:** Use AI to suggest products to users based on their browsing history, search queries, and watchlist.
- [ ] **Consolidate Your Backend:** You have both Appwrite and Firebase in the project. Simplifying to a single Backend-as-a-Service could streamline development, reduce complexity, and potentially lower costs.

### 4. Build a Community
- [ ] **Social Sharing:** Make it easy for users to share great deals with friends on social media or messaging apps.
- [ ] **Bargain Feed:** Create a "live feed" page showing the best deals and most recent price drops happening across the city.
